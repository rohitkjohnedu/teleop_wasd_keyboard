# teleop_WASD_keyboard
This is a node which listens to keyboard input and publishes a topic which can be used to operate a service robot moving on a plane. This was inspired by teleop_twist_keyboard [1]
## Aim
To make my own teleop node. It works like racing game. WASD controls the speed. Space for braking.
